# Holo-Ricing

**A Linux customization project themed around Hololive VTubers**

Holo-Rice is a comprehensive collection of Linux customization scripts and configurations that transforms your Linux environment with beautiful Hololive-themed aesthetics. This project brings the colorful and engaging world of Hololive VTubers to your desktop through carefully crafted ricing configurations.

## What is Ricing? üîß

"Ricing" is the art of customizing and personalizing your Linux operating system to improve both its appearance and functionality. The term originated from the car enthusiast community, where "RICE" stood for "Race Inspired Cosmetic Enhancement," referring to visual modifications that enhanced the aesthetic appeal of vehicles. In the Linux world, ricing involves:

- Customizing desktop environments and window managers
- Modifying system themes, icons, and color schemes
- Configuring terminal appearances and behaviors
- Personalizing boot screens, lock screens, and wallpapers
- Optimizing workflows and system interfaces

Ricing allows users to create a fully personalized computing environment that reflects their preferences and enhances their daily computing experience.
